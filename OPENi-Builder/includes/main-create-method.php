    <p>We want to offer maximum flexibility when creating the methods for you objects.</p>
    <p>Customizing, etc... There are 3 options for creating the method that best suits your needs.</p>

    <h3>So, let's start... What do you want to do?</h3>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Combine 2 or more existing methods into one new method</h4>
                    <p>You can select a set of methods to be called with just one call and also filter the parameters of the second method based on the response of the first</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Build a new method</h4>
                    <p>Create a new method by using the fields and alternatives you see fit!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Change an existing method</h4>
                    <p>OK, we need some more information... Why do you want to change the method?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>I found that a method's field name is incorrect and I want to help!</h4>
                            <p>The method will be marked as not working properly and a notification will be sent to its creator...</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>I want to change the fields that the method returns!</h4>
                            <p>I want to get different fields from the method. Maybe I also want to add some more fields to it...</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
